<h3> Grading </h3>
As your syllabus states, homework is <b> 25% (!) </b> of your final grade. Homework assignments are assigned weekly and will be graded and posted on Canvas <b> 2-3 days </b> after submission. I will then post the answers to the homework assignments on Canvas. 
<br> <br> Note: I will allow <b> 2 late </b> homework assignments. There will be a 10% deduction of the homework grade for every day late (up to 3 days). This means the highest grade you can get on the assignment after submission 1 day late is 90%, 2 days late, 80%, and 3 days late 70%. Submitted any later will count as a 0. Any other late assignments will count as a 0.
